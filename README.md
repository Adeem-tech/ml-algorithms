# ML Algorithms in Python

This repository contains basic implementations of common Machine Learning algorithms written from scratch in Python.

## Algorithms Included

- Linear Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- ID3 Decision Tree

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib

## Purpose

This project is created for learning and understanding core ML algorithms without using sklearn and follwoing the basic easy to understand steps for a static data set.
